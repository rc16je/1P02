  <p>“Why am I sad?”. “I don’t understand, I have everything...fame, fortune, and love. And yet here I am…” Maivvis says to herself in the mirror. “I must be crazy...anyone in my position would be happy, grateful, full of life. No one would be crazy enough to complain. What's wrong with me…” She begins to sob. “I must be crazy..no i am crazy..I have to be…” She holds her head with both hands, frustrated and crying. Her mascara starts to run. “Why do I have to be this way? What happened to me..” “Am I feeling lonely?” Her sobbing increases, she places her palm to the mirror. “Im loved, I am!” She screams. “I know I am, I’m perfect!” She slams her fist and the mirror shatters. She gasps for air, breathing heavy and fast. The shards cut deep into her hand, blood drips all over the sink. She stares blankly into the broken mirror, her hands are shaking uncontrollably.  Her blood drips onto the brown marble tile. Her expression changes dramatically. She takes a large deep breath and exhales. She smiles softly and turns to walk out of the washroom paying no attention to the glass or her hand. Maivvis hums her favorite melody while she runs water over her cuts. Then bandages them carefully. She makes herself a small cappuccino and sits quietly on her elegant white suede Soderhamn, imported from Scandinavia last winter. She sips her cappuccino calmly and stares out of her grand window. She rubs the bottom of her feet on her fluffy white carpet, Maivvis was never a fan of the cold tile floor even as a child. She would have changed her loft to a carpet floor but she loved the sophisticated look of the brown marble. She stares blankly at the tall metal buildings surrounding her loft, living in the heart of downtown losses that sense of isolation from the world. But to Maivvis she felt even more lonely in the city then she could ever feel in nature. If that was the case why on earth would she push herself to be in the city, it's simple she is terrified of being alone even if that drives her insane. Maivvis opens her tiny little white book that sat on her coffee table, she wrote“I am who you want me to be” the title of her new hit song. Her episode lead her to inspiration for her new album.  There was a knock on the door. Her fluent writing was interrupted, she called out “Who is it?” A male voice called back.“A big fan” Maivvis was startled, a fan she thought. Impossible, no one could get past security, she lives on the 58th floor. There are layers and layers of security to get through. She assumed it was a practical joke from her friends to calm herself. She placed her white vintage cappuccino cup as well as her little book down on her glass coffee table. She checks herself out in the mirror by the door to make sure she looks up to standards. She gets on her tippy toes to check the peephole if it's one of her girlfriends. Maivvis is surprised to find nothing but a random smile smudging onto her peephole. She finds the joke rather amusing and plays along. “Jay, I know it's you” she laughs sarcastically.</p>
