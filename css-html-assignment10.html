	<p>Zero’s soul is trapped inside of Maivvis. She does not believe she has the power to summon Zero or any other spirits including her own magic. All beings have magic abilities that correspond with their body/mind/soul. Because Maivvis has a personality disorder this creates many different personas that can be summoned. She can eventually use takeover magic that allows that spirit to fight with her. And/or summon multiple spirits to fight with. Zero is special because she belongs in Cronos, she is the alternate-version of Maivvis who is already strong and powerful.
	Once Zero is free from Maivvis, she is lost in a world of magic with none herself. She finds herself powerless, forcing her back to her normal world. She cant stand her world anymore, becoming quickly depressed and angry at herself for not being like Zero (all powerful and strong) she is desperate to go back to Cronos and make a life of her own. The only way for her to become magically strong like Zero is to master TakeOver Magic, and poses a Spirit. But this takes too much magical power that Maivvis does not have.
	To get to this magic level she becomes a reaper, at this point she finds a strong spirit to make a contract with, a bird like spirit in the shape of a scythe. The end of the story after fighting the “villain”. The prophecy comes true and Zero becomes the One true god, the old creators (demon and angel vanish) Zero and Maivvis take their place. Zero is the creator and Maivvis the destroyer. Maivvis realizes her errors to get to this place of power, and desperately wishes for her old life back. She often watches the alternate reality where she never found Cronos. Through her greed for power and envy she became the villain herself. Through her development as a character she loses her mind a bit, always being compared to Zero and never being good enough. The pain of losing who she once was, a proud young girl. To use her magic properly her will must be strong a pure. But her anxiety and depression possessed her to become a monster, she fought against Zero. With pain and grief she lost, because Zero mastered her God Form. While Maivvis didn’t have one at the time.
	Maivvis had to purify her soul by defeating her depression in order for Zero to gift her a new chance. At the end Zero blesses Maivvis and allows her to be reborn in her human world (with technology) With Zero being the one god left. The world she creates has aspects of the digital world that was created by Glitch. A uniform human world like ours. (which was Maivvis’s world originally)
